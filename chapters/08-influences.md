The joke is that Smalltalk failed to take over the world. The punchline is that it succeeded—it just wore disguises.

## The Obvious Children

### Objective-C: The Centaur

Objective-C was literally Smalltalk syntax grafted onto C, like a computational centaur. Brad Cox looked at C and Smalltalk and said, "Why choose?" Apple agreed, and thus iOS apps are basically Smalltalk programs that don't know it.

Every time an iPhone app sends a message like `[object doSomething:withThis]`, that's Smalltalk syntax surviving in the wild. The square brackets are a dead giveaway—it's like Smalltalk left its fingerprints all over Apple's ecosystem. Swift may be slowly replacing it, but Objective-C proved that you could sneak Smalltalk into millions of devices by pretending it was C.

### Ruby: The Love Child

Ruby is what happens when Smalltalk has a fling with Perl at a scripting language convention. Yukihiro Matsumoto admitted he wanted "a language more powerful than Perl and more object-oriented than Python," but what he really meant was "Smalltalk that uses files."

Ruby on Rails conquered web development using patterns that Smalltalk invented in the '80s. The irony is delicious: the web development community celebrated Rails as revolutionary while Smalltalkers muttered, "We did that with Seaside, but with better debugging." Ruby is Smalltalk that learned to hide its parentage well enough to get invited to all the parties.

### Java: The Corporate Suit

Java took Smalltalk's virtual machine and object model, removed the fun parts, added static typing, and sold it to enterprise. It's like Smalltalk went to business school and came back wearing a suit. The JVM is basically a Smalltalk VM that forgot how to do `become:` and gained the ability to please managers.

James Gosling has admitted that Java was influenced by Smalltalk, though you'd never know it from the syntax. It's like Smalltalk underwent witness protection—new identity, new look, but the same basic DNA underneath all that ceremonial boilerplate.

## The Secret Influences

### IDE Evolution

Every IDE with code completion? Smalltalk had it in 1980. Refactoring tools? Smalltalk invented the term. Test-driven development? Smalltalk was doing it before it had a acronym. Live programming? Smalltalk's been living it since birth.

When you use IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio Code, or any modern IDE, you're using ideas that Smalltalk pioneered when most programmers were still using line editors. The difference is that Smalltalk didn't see these as features to add to a text editor—they were natural consequences of treating programming as a conversation with live objects.

### Agile and Extreme Programming

The Agile movement? Kent Beck and Ward Cunningham developed it while working in Smalltalk. Extreme Programming? Born in a Smalltalk project. The emphasis on short iterations, constant refactoring, and pair programming all emerged from Smalltalk's culture of live, exploratory programming.

It's not coincidence—it's causation. Smalltalk's environment naturally led to these practices. When you can change code while it's running, refactoring becomes natural. When your tests can run in milliseconds, TDD becomes practical. When your environment is live, short iterations become inevitable.

### Design Patterns

The Gang of Four's "Design Patterns" book used Smalltalk for half its examples. Why? Because patterns are clearer in a pure object-oriented language. The Visitor pattern, the Strategy pattern, the Observer pattern—they all make more sense when everything really is an object and behavior really is determined by message passing.

Modern programmers learn these patterns in Java or C++, struggling with syntax and ceremony, not realizing they're learning translations of ideas that are native to Smalltalk.

## The Modern Reverberations

In 2025, when you:

### Hot-Reload Your React Application
You're using an idea Smalltalk had in 1972. The difference is that Smalltalk didn't call it "hot-reloading"—it called it "programming."

### Use Swift's Message Passing
Swift may have C-like syntax, but its semantics are increasingly Smalltalk-like. Optional chaining (`object?.method?.anotherMethod`) is just message passing with nil-checking.

### Debug with Chrome DevTools
The ability to inspect live objects, modify them on the fly, and see immediate results? That's the Smalltalk development experience, just limited to JavaScript and wearing a modern UI.

### Write Everything as Microservices
Microservices passing messages? That's Smalltalk's object model scaled up to the network level. Each service is an object, REST calls are messages, JSON is the serialization format. It's Smalltalk distributed, just with more latency and yaml files.

### Use Electron for Desktop Apps
Electron apps are essentially using the browser as a universal VM, just like Smalltalk uses its VM. The difference is that Smalltalk's VM was designed for this purpose, while browsers accidentally became application platforms.

### Practice "Everything Is a Component"
Modern frontend frameworks with their component-based architecture are rediscovering what Smalltalk knew: composition of simple, message-passing entities is powerful. React components are just objects that don't know they're objects.

## The Language That Taught Languages

### Python's Object Model
Python's "everything is an object" philosophy comes straight from Smalltalk, just with significant whitespace instead of square brackets. When Python programmers discover they can add methods to classes at runtime, they're discovering something Smalltalk considered table stakes.

### JavaScript's Prototype Chain
JavaScript's prototypical inheritance is a weird cousin of Smalltalk's class-based system, but the core idea—objects responding to messages based on their type—is pure Smalltalk. JavaScript just made it confusing enough that most developers don't realize what they're using.

### C#'s LINQ
LINQ is essentially Smalltalk's collection protocol with syntax sugar. `Select`, `Where`, `Aggregate`—these are Smalltalk's `collect:`, `select:`, `inject:into:` wearing C# clothing.

## The Ultimate Irony

Smalltalk's greatest contribution might be proving that being right doesn't mean winning. It showed that elegance, consistency, and power aren't enough if you can't play well with others. Every successful language since has been less pure, less elegant, and less consistent than Smalltalk—and more successful because of it.

But here's the thing: Smalltalk doesn't care. It's still here, still pure, still showing us what programming could be if we weren't so worried about what programming should be. Its ideas have infected everything, from our IDEs to our methodologies to our languages. We live in a world that Smalltalk imagined, we just built it with inferior tools.

## The Ideas That Won't Die

- **Everything is an object**: Now mainstream, even in languages that fake it
- **Message passing**: The foundation of everything from Erlang to microservices
- **Live programming**: The future everyone's trying to build
- **Reflection**: Now expected in any serious language
- **Garbage collection**: Once controversial, now universal
- **Virtual machines**: The foundation of modern computing
- **Image-based development**: Coming back through containers and notebooks

## The Final Influence

Perhaps Smalltalk's greatest influence is the one we can't see yet. Every few years, a new generation of programmers discovers Smalltalk and asks, "Why aren't we programming like this?" They then go on to create new languages, new tools, new methodologies that inch us closer to Smalltalk's vision.

Smalltalk isn't influential because languages copy its syntax—they don't. It's influential because once you understand Smalltalk, you can't unsee its ideas. They're too powerful, too elegant, too right to ignore. So we keep reinventing them, keep rediscovering them, keep pretending they're new.

In the end, Smalltalk's legacy isn't in the languages that directly descended from it—it's in the fact that we can't seem to escape its gravitational pull. Every language designed after Smalltalk is either moving toward it or defining itself in opposition to it. That's not failure; that's the kind of success that transcends market share.
