Just when you thought Smalltalk couldn't get more opinionated, along comes Glamorous Toolkit (GT) with a radical proposition: what if your development environment was as malleable as your code?

## The Moldability Manifesto

GT doesn't just want you to write programs; it wants you to sculpt custom tools for understanding them. Every object in GT can have custom visualizations, custom inspectors, custom everything. It's like giving every developer their own personal Tony Stark workshop, except instead of building Iron Man suits, you're building bespoke lenses for viewing your code.

The GT team observed that developers spend 50% of their time reading code and another 40% trying to understand it, leaving only 10% for actual writing. Their response? Make the 90% as powerful as possible. In GT, you don't just read code—you experience it through custom-built archaeological tools that you create on the fly.

## Examples, Examples Everywhere

GT's most controversial feature might be its approach to documentation: examples aren't just documentation, they're executable specifications that also serve as tests, tutorials, and regression detectors. Every method can have examples that:

- Show how to use it
- Verify it still works
- Serve as living documentation
- Enable example-driven development

It's documentation that can't lie because it runs every time you save.

## The Lepiter Revolution

GT includes Lepiter, a "knowledge management system" that makes other note-taking tools look like cave paintings. Imagine if Jupyter Notebooks and Notion had a baby, and that baby was raised by Smalltalk. You can:

- Mix prose, code, and visualizations in living documents
- Execute code snippets in place
- Link knowledge to actual running systems
- Build computational narratives that explain themselves

## Who's Embracing the Moldability?

- **Software archaeologists** exploring legacy codebases
- **Data scientists** who want more than static visualizations
- **Consultants** building custom analysis tools for each client
- **Researchers** who need to explain complex systems
- **Teams** practicing example-driven development

## The Beautiful Madness

GT is what happens when you take Smalltalk's "everything is an object" philosophy to its logical extreme and then keep going. It's simultaneously the most powerful and most overwhelming Smalltalk experience available. You either get it immediately and can't imagine working any other way, or you run screaming back to your IDE where buttons stay in one place and inspectors don't have existential crises.

## The Inspector Renaissance

In most development environments, an inspector shows you an object's variables. In GT, an inspector is a portal to multiple dimensions of understanding. Inspecting a file? See its contents, its git history, its dependencies, and a custom visualization you just invented. Inspecting a number? See its factors, its binary representation, its position on a number line, and why not, its representation as a color.

The inspector isn't a tool in GT—it's a meta-tool for building tools. Every object can teach the inspector new ways to be inspected. It's recursive brilliance that occasionally recurses into madness.

## The Coder Experience

GT's Coder isn't just a text editor with syntax highlighting. It's a moldable editor that understands the structure of your code at a semantic level. You can:

- Expand and collapse methods like outline nodes
- See examples inline with the code
- Navigate through code as a graph, not just files
- Create custom workflows for specific tasks
- Build domain-specific programming environments on the fly

It's not about writing code faster—it's about understanding code deeper.

## The Visualization Playground

GT treats visualization as a first-class programming activity. Creating a custom visualization for your objects isn't a separate task requiring a charting library—it's just another method on your object. Want to see your data as a tree? Add a tree view method. Need a custom graph layout? Build it in a playground and attach it to your class.

This leads to beautiful situations where debugging becomes a visual experience. Instead of stepping through code line by line, you watch your data transform through custom visualizations you create in real-time. It's debugging as performance art.

## The Learning Curve That's Actually a Cliff

Let's be honest: GT has a learning curve that makes other Smalltalks look like gentle slopes. It's not that it's hard to use—it's that it's hard to understand why you'd want to use it this way. The first week with GT is like learning to see a new color. You know something's different, but you can't quite explain what or why it matters.

Then one day, you're building a custom inspector for your domain objects, linking it to live documentation, creating examples that serve as both tests and tutorials, and you realize: you're not programming anymore. You're having a conversation with your system, and your system is talking back.

## The Future of Moldability

GT isn't trying to be a better IDE—it's trying to obsolete the concept of an IDE altogether. In GT's vision, every project has its own custom development environment, molded specifically for its domain. The tools you use to build a compiler are different from the tools you use to build a web app, and both are different from the tools you use to analyze Shakespeare.

It's ambitious, overwhelming, and occasionally incomprehensible. But it's also the most innovative thing happening in development environments today. While everyone else is adding features to their IDEs, GT is questioning whether we should have IDEs at all.
