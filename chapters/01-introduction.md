# Chapter 1: Introduction - The Language That Refuses to Die

In 2025, declaring yourself a Smalltalk developer is a bit like admitting you collect vinyl records or practice calligraphy. People nod respectfully, secretly wondering if you also churn your own butter. Yet here we are, half a century after Alan Kay's team at Xerox PARC birthed this peculiar language, and Smalltalk not only survives—it thrives in pockets of innovation that would make its ancestors proud.

The joke in programming circles is that Smalltalk has been "dying" for thirty years, which makes it the healthiest corpse in computer science. While languages born decades later have already fossilized in version control graveyards, Smalltalk continues to evolve through its various implementations, each one a unique snowflake in the blizzard of object-oriented programming.

This book isn't about teaching you Smalltalk syntax—if you need that, you're probably already lost in a sea of square brackets wondering why `3 + 4 * 5` equals 35 instead of 23. (Spoiler: left-to-right evaluation, no operator precedence. You're welcome.) Instead, we're here to explore the delightful chaos of modern Smalltalk implementations, each one solving different problems for different tribes of developers who all agree on one thing: messages are better than methods, and everything really should be an object.

## The Family Reunion Nobody Asked For

Imagine a family reunion where everyone shares the same DNA but has evolved in wildly different directions. Squeak shows up wearing tie-dye and talking about educational revolution. Pharo arrives in a business suit, PowerPoint at the ready. Glamorous Toolkit floats in on a cloud of moldability manifestos. GNU Smalltalk lurks in the corner with a terminal window, muttering about POSIX compliance. And Amber? Amber's livestreaming the whole thing to the browser.

Each implementation represents a different philosophy about what Smalltalk should be in the 21st century. They share the same fundamental beliefs—everything is an object, computation happens through message passing, and the environment should be live and introspective—but their expressions of these beliefs vary wildly.

## Why This Book, Why Now?

The Smalltalk landscape in 2025 is more vibrant than it has been in years. The rise of microservices made people appreciate message-passing architectures. The JavaScript ecosystem's complexity has developers yearning for Smalltalk's elegant simplicity. Machine learning researchers have discovered that Smalltalk's live environments are perfect for exploratory data analysis. And a new generation of developers, raised on REPLs and hot-reloading, find Smalltalk's "always running" philosophy surprisingly modern.

But navigating this landscape is treacherous. Choose the wrong Smalltalk for your project, and you'll spend more time fighting the implementation than solving your problem. This book is your guide through the wilderness, helping you understand not just what each Smalltalk can do, but what it wants to do, what it dreams of doing, and what it absolutely refuses to do no matter how nicely you ask.
