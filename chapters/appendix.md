For the brave souls ready to dive in, here's where to find each implementation in 2025:

## Major Implementations

### Squeak
- **Website**: https://squeak.org
- **Getting Started**: Download the all-in-one package and prepare for wonder
- **Best For**: Education, research, multimedia experimentation
- **Learning Curve**: Moderate to steep (the environment is the challenge)
- **Community**: Active mailing list, wiki, and annual conferences

### Pharo
- **Website**: https://pharo.org
- **Getting Started**: Get the launcher for easy version management
- **Best For**: Professional development, web applications, data analysis
- **Learning Curve**: Moderate (most approachable for traditional developers)
- **Community**: Discord, mailing list, active GitHub presence

### Glamorous Toolkit
- **Website**: https://gtoolkit.com
- **Getting Started**: Download and prepare to have your mind reshaped
- **Best For**: Software analysis, moldable development, knowledge management
- **Learning Curve**: Steep (new concepts, not just new syntax)
- **Community**: Discord, blog, regular demos and workshops

### GNU Smalltalk
- **Installation**: Package manager of your choice, or build from source
- **Getting Started**: `gst` in your terminal, that's it
- **Best For**: Scripting, Unix integration, learning Smalltalk concepts
- **Learning Curve**: Gentle (if you know Unix)
- **Community**: Mailing list, GNU project infrastructure

### Amber
- **Website**: https://amber-lang.net
- **Getting Started**: `npm install -g amber-cli`
- **Best For**: Web applications, browser-based development
- **Learning Curve**: Moderate (must understand both Smalltalk and JavaScript)
- **Community**: GitHub, Slack channel

## Specialized Implementations

### Cuis
- **Website**: https://cuis-smalltalk.org
- **Getting Started**: Download the image for Smalltalk therapy
- **Best For**: Learning, minimalist projects, understanding Smalltalk essence
- **Learning Curve**: Gentle to moderate

### Dolphin
- **Website**: https://github.com/dolphinsmalltalk
- **Getting Started**: Windows only, but native Windows development awaits
- **Best For**: Windows desktop applications
- **Learning Curve**: Moderate

### Others
- **Smalltalk/X**: For when speed matters more than everything else
- **VisualWorks**: If you're maintaining enterprise systems from the 1990s
- **GemStone/S**: When you need objects that outlive civilizations
- **Newspeak**: For programming language researchers

## Learning Resources

### Books (Still Relevant in 2025)
- "Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns" by Kent Beck
- "Squeak by Example" (free online)
- "Pharo by Example" (free online)
- "Deep into Pharo" (free online)

### Online Courses
- MOOCs on Pharo (check FUN platform)
- YouTube channels dedicated to each implementation
- Interactive tutorials within each environment

### Community Resources
- **Reddit**: r/smalltalk (small but helpful)
- **Stack Overflow**: smalltalk tag (quiet but answered)
- **Discord/Slack**: Each major implementation has channels
- **Conferences**: ESUG (European Smalltalk User Group), Smalltalks, Camp Smalltalk

## Choosing Your First Smalltalk

### If You're Coming From...

**JavaScript/Web Development**: Start with Amber or Pharo
**Enterprise Java/C#**: Try Pharo or VisualWorks
**Python/Ruby**: Pharo or GNU Smalltalk will feel most familiar
**Systems Programming**: GNU Smalltalk or Smalltalk/X
**Research/Academia**: Squeak or Glamorous Toolkit
**Windows Development**: Dolphin Smalltalk
**Just Curious**: Pharo has the gentlest learning curve

## The First Week Survival Guide

1. **Accept the Image**: It's not a program, it's a living world
2. **Embrace the Browser**: It's not a text editor, it's an object explorer
3. **Learn the Shortcuts**: Alt+. (Cmd+. on Mac) stops everything
4. **Save Your Image**: But also learn to use version control
5. **Read the Examples**: They're better than documentation
6. **Join the Community**: Smalltalkers love helping newcomers
7. **Build Something Small**: A todo app is traditional
8. **Don't Fight It**: Smalltalk has opinions, listen to them first

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

- **"Where are my files?"** - They're in the image, stop looking
- **"How do I deploy this?"** - Each implementation has its way, read the docs
- **"Why is 3 + 4 * 5 = 35?"** - Left to right evaluation, no precedence
- **"I broke everything!"** - Restart with a fresh image
- **"This feels weird"** - That's normal, give it two weeks
- **"Nobody else uses this"** - True, but those who do are passionate

## The Two-Week Test

Give any Smalltalk two weeks of honest effort. That's enough time to:
- Get comfortable with the environment
- Build something non-trivial
- Experience live programming
- Understand message passing
- Have at least three "aha!" moments

If after two weeks you're not converted, you've at least learned a different way of thinking about programming. If you are converted, welcome to a small but passionate community that's been quietly building the future since 1972.

## Final Advice

Don't try to use Smalltalk like other languages. Don't fight the image-based development (except in GNU Smalltalk). Don't expect files and folders. Don't look for a main() method.

Instead, explore. Play. Send messages to objects just to see what happens. Build tools to understand your code. Modify the system while it's running. Experience programming as a conversation, not a compilation.

Remember: choosing a Smalltalk is like choosing a philosophy. Choose wisely, but don't choose too seriously—it's supposed to be fun.

*"In Smalltalk, you don't write programs. You have conversations with objects."*

*Start your conversation today.*
