# Chapter 2: Squeak - The Mouse That Roared

If Smalltalk implementations were bands, Squeak would be the one that never sold out. Born in 1996 from the original Smalltalk-80 code (literally—Apple released it and Dan Ingalls said "hold my beer"), Squeak has remained true to the original vision while somehow also being the most experimental of all Smalltalks.

## The Eternal Playground

Squeak's motto might as well be "What if we never stopped playing?" It's the implementation that asks, "Why shouldn't children program multimedia applications?" and "What if the development environment was also a game engine?" These aren't rhetorical questions—Squeak actually built Etoys and Scratch on these premises, teaching millions of kids to code while the "serious" programming world wasn't looking.

The Squeak community has a peculiar habit of solving problems nobody knew existed. Need a programming environment that runs identically on everything from a Raspberry Pi to a supercomputer? Squeak's got you. Want to simulate biological systems while composing music? There's a package for that. Looking for a Smalltalk that can modify its own virtual machine while running? Welcome home, you beautiful weirdo.

## The Technical Peculiarities

Squeak's virtual machine, now evolved into the Cog VM, is a testament to what happens when computer scientists have too much fun. It features:

- **Just-in-time compilation** that would make Java jealous
- **Become:** the infamous method that can transform any object into any other object (yes, you can turn the number 3 into a HTTPServer if you really want to)
- **Morphic:** a UI framework so flexible it's basically Play-Doh for pixels
- **The ability to save your entire world** (image) and resume it decades later, like a computational time capsule

In Squeak, you don't just write programs—you grow them like digital gardens. The image-based development means your code, data, and running processes all live together in harmony, or occasionally, in spectacular chaos.

## Who Uses Squeak in 2025?

- **Educators** who believe programming should be taught like art, not engineering
- **Researchers** exploring everything from music composition to cellular automata
- **Digital artists** who treat code as a medium, not just a tool
- **That one person in every organization** who insists on using it for production systems and somehow makes it work

## The Squeak Paradox

Squeak's greatest strength and weakness is the same: it refuses to compromise. While other Smalltalks have adapted to the "file-based development with version control" world, Squeak doubles down on the image-based approach. Git integration? "Why would you version files when you can version objects?" they ask, while the rest of us weep into our merge conflicts.

The beauty of Squeak is that it doesn't care about your conventions. It's the punk rock of programming languages—loud, uncompromising, and absolutely convinced that everyone else is doing it wrong. And sometimes, just sometimes, it's right.

## Living in the Image

The Squeak experience is unlike any other programming environment. When you open a Squeak image, you're not starting a program—you're waking up a living system. Variables from last Tuesday are still there. That experimental class you wrote at 3 AM is still running. The debugger window you forgot to close is patiently waiting with your stack trace preserved.

This persistence can be magical or maddening. Imagine if your entire development environment, including all running processes, test results, and half-finished thoughts, could be saved to a file and resumed on a different computer, in a different year, on a different operating system. That's not a feature in Squeak; it's the fundamental assumption.

## The Educational Revolution That Actually Happened

While Silicon Valley was busy "disrupting" education with video lectures and multiple-choice quizzes, Squeak quietly revolutionized how children learn programming. Etoys turned programming into storytelling. Scratch (originally built in Squeak) made coding as intuitive as snapping LEGO blocks together.

The genius wasn't in making programming easier—it was in making it unnecessary to know you were programming. Children using Etoys don't learn syntax; they learn that computers are tools for expressing ideas. They don't debug code; they fix behaviors that don't match their intentions. It's Smalltalk's philosophy taken to its logical conclusion: if everything is an object, then everything can be played with.

## The Future of Playing

In 2025, Squeak continues to be the R&D department of the Smalltalk world. While other implementations chase industry trends, Squeak chases ideas. Virtual reality interfaces? Squeak's experimenting with programming in 3D space. Quantum computing? There's probably a Squeak package simulating quantum objects. AI integration? Squeak developers are teaching objects to learn about themselves.

The question isn't whether Squeak will ever become mainstream—it won't, and it doesn't want to. The question is what ideas from Squeak will sneak into mainstream programming five years from now. Because if history teaches us anything, it's that today's Squeak experiment is tomorrow's industry standard, just with more compromises and less fun.
