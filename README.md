# Smalltalk About Smalltalk

A witty and insightful tour through the living dialects of a revolutionary language that refuses to die.

## About This Book

In 2025, the Smalltalk ecosystem is more diverse and vibrant than ever. This book explores the various implementations of Smalltalk—Squeak, Pharo, Glamorous Toolkit, GNU Smalltalk, Amber, and others—examining what sets them apart, their adoption patterns, and their lasting influence on modern programming.

## What You'll Find

- **Not a tutorial**: This isn't about learning Smalltalk syntax
- **A landscape guide**: Understanding which Smalltalk fits your needs
- **Historical context**: How each implementation evolved and why
- **Modern relevance**: Smalltalk's DNA in today's languages
- **Occasional humor**: Because programming should be fun

## Who This Book Is For

- Developers curious about Smalltalk's various flavors
- Smalltalk practitioners choosing between implementations
- Programming language enthusiasts
- Anyone who enjoys reading about programming culture and history
- People who think `3 + 4 * 5 = 35` makes perfect sense

## Why Smalltalk Still Matters

Fifty years after its creation, Smalltalk continues to influence modern programming. Every time you:
- Use an IDE with code completion
- Hot-reload your application
- Practice test-driven development
- Refactor with automated tools
- Send messages between microservices

You're using ideas Smalltalk pioneered when the internet was still ARPANET.

## The Philosophy

> "In Smalltalk, everything happens somewhere else." - Adele Goldberg

This book explores that "somewhere else"—the various implementations where Smalltalk's revolutionary ideas continue to evolve, inspire, and occasionally confuse programmers worldwide.
